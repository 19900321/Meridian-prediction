This is the python code about how we prepare the data for model predict (the herb meridian matrix, 
herb feature matrix and compound meridian matrix).
The basic files we use are as followings:

A. herb basic information----'herb_basic_information.csv'

B. compound basic inforamtion----'compound_basic_information.csv'

C. compound feature----'compound_feature.csv'

ADME feature was calculted by SwissADME (http://www.swissadme.ch/index.php#top). Fingerprint was calulated 
by padel descriptor (http://www.yapcwsoft.com/dd/padeldescriptor/). 

D. herb compound pairs----'compound_herb_pair.csv'
